				Well, as I said, this list of musicians was by no means a complete list or exhaustive. It would take a very large database to talk about all of the great guitarists through the years. If you were to say about this site, "Well, that's your opinion!". In part you probably right, but let me say that I have been playing the guitar for many years and have performed in front of large crowds before. Though my future career will be in website design, playing and practicing the guitar is something I do for an hour or two just about everyday. God willing, I will play for the rest of my life and the hereafter. It's a lot of fun for me to play both lead and rhythm as I think all guitarists should. Some have a knack for both and some do not. I love lead guitar a little more because I love melodies. My tastes in music are ecletic and I play in almost in any genre. I can play by ear and also understand music theory.</p>
				
				<p>I tend to listen to music with a trained, logical ear. That is not to say that I don't enjoy a very simple song because I do. I enjoy the songs that are easy to play as well as the difficult because both are fun and entertaining. All of my experience has taught me though, that generally people form their opinions from other people's opinions without thinking it through. I am saying just because someone says something it's does not necessarily mean it's true, even if they seem to know what they are talking about. It is just their opinion. It is good to examine one's thoughts before taking a stance on anything, really.
				</p>
				<p>
				I have written long about this already and so I will end with this: keep listening to what you enjoy, but remember that just because someone is popular, it doesn't make them great or exceptional. People can be popular for other reasons than just how they may look on stage. Think about it.
