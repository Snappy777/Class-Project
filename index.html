			<h1> Welcome to my site!</h1>

			<p>Many people who love music have an opinion on who is the best guitarist ever. But do they really? Some say that Jimmy Hendrix, others Jimmy Paige or Eddie Van Halen and others are posited. In most respects though, it's true to say that unless they play the guitar at a knowledgeable level, they really can't give an informed opinion on who is and who isn't great. In some sense, it doesn't really matter because in general, people like whomever they like and nobody's going to tell them different. But most guitarists think differently then that. 
			</p>

			<p>Guitarists understand that to become great at their craft, they need to listen, practice, listen, practice, listen, practice and ummm... PRACTICE and LISTEN! Lol! It's been said too many times that "practice makes perfect", but the truth is that <b><em>"Perfect practice makes perfect".</em></b> There are many things that make a guitarist elite and one of them is learning the right techniques from someone who knows what they are doing. <b>This is very important.</b> Some of the most famous guitarists ever known have had such bad techniques that it held them back from becoming a great player. Instead, they were good, but not elite. Sooner or later, experienced guitar players realize this truth. Every so often I am asked who I think is the best guitar player ever. My answer to them was, "No one!". My reasoning is that there are too many great players to say that only one is the best. I have heard said that the only way to be the best at anything is to be the only one doing it. Food for thought. I think players can be among the best, but not the best. Now, some have their favorite(s), but that is different from saying they are the best of all time. 
            </p>

            <p>So, I'd like to share with you some guitar players that are not only popular, but are also considered among the elite. They are listed on this page with no ranking. Please try the links provided after at the end of the microcosm of info for each player. Hope you like it!</p>
